How the User Tower Interacts with a Feature Store

Feature Store (External DB)	
Stores raw, current user data (e.g., Firebase, DynamoDB, Redis).
Ex:Raw data (country='US', risk_score=50).

User Tower (user_tower.h5)	
Converts raw features into a dense vector (the embedding).
Ex: Dense vector (e.g., [0.1, -0.5, 0.9, ...]).

Feature Store: A request comes in for a recommendation. The system first queries your Feature Store to get the latest, raw user features (e.g., the user's country, device type, and recent trading activity).

User Tower (The Translator): These raw features are then fed into the loaded user_tower.h5 model.

Embedding Output: The User Tower model processes the features (including the Embedding layers you saw in the code) and outputs a single vector, the User Embedding.

Recommendation Retrieval: This User Embedding is then used to quickly search a vector database containing all the pre-calculated Asset Embeddings (from asset_tower.h5) to find the best matching items.

So, while the feature store provides the inputs, the User Tower provides the representation that makes the recommendation calculation possible.
